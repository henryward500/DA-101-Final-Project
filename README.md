# Intro-to-Data-Analytics-DA-101-Final-Project
Personal final project from Intro to Data Analytics (DA 101) at Denison University
Part 1 of my DA101 project uses data from two subjects in order to fullfill the Data tool glossary process 
and part of my exploratory analysis. 
To setup part 2 of this project I am exploring World Happiness datasets from 2015 to 2017 
("2015.csv", "2016.csv", and "2017.csv"). 
In addition to the World Happiness datasets, to demonstrate skills and for data tool glossary, 
I am using the "1415NBAcleaned.csv" dataset from class as basketball play-by-play data is fun to work with. 

Data was obtained from Kaggle
